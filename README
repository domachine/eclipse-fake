I've written some Emacs bindings to provide easy control of the tool just out
of Emacs.

Installation:

1. Simply copy the file somewhere Emacs can find it and put the following into
   your .emacs file:

   ;; #Elisp snippet
   (setq eclipse-exporter-program
         (expand-file-name "/path/to/eclipse-fake.sh"))

   (autoload 'eclipse-export-project "eclipse-exporter"
     "The eclipse exportation binding function" "sProject-dir: ")
   ;; #End of Elisp snippet

2. Now you can use it with `M-x eclipse-export-project <RET> /path/to/your/project <RET>'

I wish all students of the university of ULM in the lecture damn f..................... "Programmierung von Systemen" much fun.
