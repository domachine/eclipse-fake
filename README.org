** Sat, 23 Apr 2011 23:46:58 +0200 -- Added possibility to pass project-path via command line

It's possible now to pass the project-path via command line:

$ ./eclipse-fake.sh /path/to/project


** Sat, 23 Apr 2011 23:42:05 +0200 -- Added configuration possibility

Eclipse-fake is now configurable through config file in $HOME called
`.eclipse-fake-rc'. The following variables can be set:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# VARIABLE=default_value

ECLIPSE_JAVA_VERSION=1.6  # Set the used java version
ECLIPSE_SRC_DIR=src       # Set the source dir name
ECLIPSE_OUTPUT_DIR=bin    # Set the output dir name
#+END_SRC

** Tue, 19 Apr 2011 21:25:51 +0200 -- Added Emacs bindings

I've written some Emacs bindings to provide easy control of the tool just out
of Emacs.

_Installation_:

  + Simply copy the file somewhere Emacs can find it and put the following into
    your .emacs file:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; #Elisp snippet
    (setq eclipse-exporter-program
          (expand-file-name "/path/to/eclipse-fake.sh"))

    (autoload 'eclipse-export-project "eclipse-exporter"
      "The eclipse exportation binding function" "sProject-dir: ")
    ;; #End of Elisp snippet
    #+END_SRC
  + Now you can use it with `M-x eclipse-export-project <RET> /path/to/your/project <RET>'

I wish all students of the university of ULM in the lecture damn f..................... "Programmierung von Systemen" much fun.
